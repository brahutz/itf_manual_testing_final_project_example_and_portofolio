## Test Design

Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases 
are boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning and use case testing.

** The test cases with stepts can be viewed here: [Dependents_test_cases.pdf](https://github.com/julai215/itf_final_project_example_and_portofolio/blob/main/Files/Final%20Project/Dependents_test_cases.pdf) **
